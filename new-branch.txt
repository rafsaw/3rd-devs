Step 1: Create and switch to a new branch. In your terminal (still in 3rd-devs-reloaded folder):
(give name you want week02 etc...)

    git checkout -b weekXX 

Step 2: Make changes
Do whatever edits you want â€” create new files, write code, etc.
Then stage and commit them:

    git add .
    git commit -m "My first changes for training"


Step 3: Push your feature branch to GitHub

    git push -u origin weekXX


You can switch between branches like this:
git checkout main      # switch to main (original)
git checkout week01    # switch back to your work
