#code change steps:
1. Make a test change
In VS Code or any editor, change a file or create a new one (e.g., hello.txt).

Then in terminal:
    
    git add .
    git commit -m "Test change in week01"

2. Switch back to main
    
    git checkout main

3. Merge your week01 branch into main

    git merge week01
This brings the changes you made in week01 into the main branch.

4. Push your updated main to GitHub

    git push
