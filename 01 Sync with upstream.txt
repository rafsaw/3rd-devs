Step-by-step: Sync with upstream

1. Fetch latest changes from upstream

	git fetch upstream

	This gets the latest commits from the original repo but does not merge them yet.

2. Merge upstream changes into your main branch

	git checkout main
	git merge upstream/main

	This updates your local main with new changes from the original repo.

	(Optional) Push to your GitHub fork:

	git push origin main


3. Merge updated main into your week01 branch
	Now bring those same updates into week01:
	
	git checkout week01
	git merge main

	(Optional) Push updated week01 to GitHub:
	git push origin week01
