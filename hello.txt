testing making changes in branch week01



Step 1: Create and switch to a new branch. In your terminal (still in 3rd-devs-reloaded folder):
(give name you want week02 etc...)

    git checkout -b weekXX 

Step 2: Make changes
Do whatever edits you want â€” create new files, write code, etc.
Then stage and commit them:

    git add .
    git commit -m "My first changes for training"


Step 3: Push your feature branch to GitHub

    git push -u origin weekXX





You can switch between branches like this:
git checkout main      # switch to main (original)
git checkout week01    # switch back to your work




 Next Step (Optional): Keep syncing with training repo
 When the training team updates their repo (i-am-alice/3rd-devs), you can pull the latest changes like this:

    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/main
    # or if you prefer rebase:
    # git rebase upstream/main

Then resolve any conflicts (if any), and push updated code to your GitHub repo:

    git push 
    #git push origin main #(not sure which one is better)



# origin	your repo: https://github.com/rafsaw/3rd-devs-reloaded.git
# upstream	training repo: https://github.com/i-am-alice/3rd-devs.git
