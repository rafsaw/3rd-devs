 Next Step (Optional): Keep syncing with training repo
 When the training team updates their repo (i-am-alice/3rd-devs), you can pull the latest changes like this:

    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/main
    # or if you prefer rebase:
    # git rebase upstream/main

Then resolve any conflicts (if any), and push updated code to your GitHub repo:

    git push 
    #git push origin main #(not sure which one is better)




Then pull those updates into your feature branch:
    git checkout my-feature
    git rebase main
    # or merge: git merge main






# origin	your repo: https://github.com/rafsaw/3rd-devs-reloaded.git
# upstream	training repo: https://github.com/i-am-alice/3rd-devs.git










Best Flow When Training Team Updates
When training team pushes new code:
 1. Make sure you're on main
    git checkout main
 2. Pull latest updates from training repo
    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/main
    git push origin main  # Optional, to sync your GitHub repo too
 3. Create a new branch for your new work
    git checkout -b week01-day02
