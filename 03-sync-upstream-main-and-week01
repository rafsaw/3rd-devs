1. Pull changes from upstream (make sure you are in main branch)

	git fetch upstream


2. Merge upstream's changes into your current branch (e.g. main):

	git checkout main
	git merge upstream/main

2.1 To finish the merge:
		If you’re in Vim, do the following:

		Press i to enter insert mode (optional — only if you want to edit the message).

		Press Esc to exit insert mode.

		:wq
		Then hit Enter.

		This will write the commit message and quit, finalizing the merge.
		
		
3. (Optional) Push merged changes to your own GitHub fork:

	git push origin main
	
	
	
To get the upstream changes into your week01 branch, you have two options:
Option 1: Merge main into week01
If you want to include all the new changes from main into week01:
	git checkout week01
	git merge main
	
Then resolve any conflicts (if any), and:
	git push origin week01
	
	
Option 2: Rebase week01 on top of main (cleaner history)
	git checkout week01
	git rebase main
Resolve conflicts if prompted (Git will guide you), then:
	git push --force-with-lease origin week01
	
	***Use this only if you're comfortable rewriting commit history or haven't pushed week01 to others yet.
